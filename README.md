#Predicting Online Shoppersâ€™ Purchasing Intentions                                                                                                                

Data Science project for the University of Toronto CHE1147: Data Mining in Engineering

This jupyter notebook explores and predicts the likelihood of a person placing an online purchase using a dataset available from Kaggle. Data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, modelling, and application were performed. Classification algorithms through both unsupervised (PCA, K-means) and supervised learning (L2 and L1 Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, gradient boosted classifier) were performed. The final model produced an accuracy of 91% and an F1 score of 0.81. Special thanks to Jeff Dryden, a great partner and friend in this project.
