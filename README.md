Data Science project for the University of Toronto CHE1147: Data Mining in Engineering

This jupyter notebook explores and predicts the likelihood of a person placing an online purchase using a dataset available from Kaggle. Data cleaning, data exploration, feature engineering, modelling, and application were performed, such that the model produced an accuracy of 91% and an F1 score of 0.81. Special thanks to Jeff Dryden who was a great partner and friend in this project.
